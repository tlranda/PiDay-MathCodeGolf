# PiDay-MathCodeGolf
A neat small-scope project inspired by SoC Discord

Use `python3 discord_puzzle.py` to run (add `--help` if you need assistance with arguments).

Also includes `make_sol.py` which is run as `python3 make_sol.py`.
+  This second script outputs an integer-only representation of pi using a strict character budget. It may be possible to beat its precision, but I doubt it. Let me know if you have something more clever!
+  The output is always written to `ans.txt` because I am lazy
